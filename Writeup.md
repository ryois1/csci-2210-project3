CSCI 2210-001 Data Structures **Project 3**
## Summary
After running 10 full rigorous simulations, we have come to the conclusion that 6 docks is optimal for the maximum profit. 7 docks profited on average $29,311.75, which is $700.41 more than the runner up of 6 docks, 28611.34. Using the data we gathered in these simulations, we can conclude that 6 docks will make more than the lower number of docks, while saving money from the cost of having more than 6 docks.
